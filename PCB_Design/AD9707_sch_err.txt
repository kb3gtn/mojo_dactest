The notes at the bottom of the schmatic are incorrect. (See dac_test.vhd for correct settings)

The AD9706 was using on the testboard here.  Pin compatible, only 12 bits instead of 14 bits depth.
VHDL code here was written and tested with AD9706 device.  firmware can be changed to support 14bits fairly easily.
